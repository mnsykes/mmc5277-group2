## Challenges

## Disparities in Commit History
We used the framework of working under individual branches that were then merged into the main site. 

(MS to further explain)

If necessary

We met three times via zoom. The first two of which were strategy sessions focused on wireframes, styles, and creative as well as understanding each individual's strengths in order to best optimize our collaborative approach. The 3rd time we met for nearly 3 hours doing a code a long working together to find solutions and create uniformity on the site.
